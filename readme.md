# Keymap Laboratory Using Corne Keyboard

This site contains that the trials in order to create special keymaps
to minimize moving the hands using Corne Keyboard, which is the cute
42 keys vertically staggered keyboard.

see: [Foostan's Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/)

My goal are:

- Can generate all keycodes defined on US 104 keyboard,
- Japanese input using SKK can be easily done, and
- Friendly to use with Emacs.
